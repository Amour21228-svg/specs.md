description: "Compare specs.md (AI-DLC) with GitHub's Spec Kit toolkit"
---

## Overview

**GitHub Spec Kit** is a lightweight, tool-agnostic toolkit with slash commands (`/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`) that structures prompts for your existing AI assistant.

**specs.md (AI-DLC)** is a full methodology implementation with phase-based agents, Mob rituals, and DDD integration.

<Info>
**Coming Soon**: specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Spec Kit-like simple flows for teams wanting a lighter entry point.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | specs.md (AI-DLC) | Spec Kit |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Type** | Full methodology | Lightweight toolkit |
| **Target** | Complex systems requiring trade-offs | Small-medium projects |
| **Approach** | Structured AI-DLC phases with methodology | Command-driven toolkit |
| **Structure** | Intents → Units → Stories | Specify → Plan → Tasks |
| **Agent Model** | Specialized phase agents | Tool-agnostic, single assistant |
| **Design Integration** | DDD as core (not optional) | Constitution file only |
| **Rituals** | Mob Elaboration, Mob Construction | None |
| **Memory** | Memory Bank (persistent context) | Constitution file |
| **Customization** | Skills, templates, memory bank | Constitution file, scripts |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Low |

## When to Choose Each

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Choose specs.md (AI-DLC) if:" icon="check">
    - You're building complex systems with architectural trade-offs
    - You need DDD integration and domain modeling
    - You want Mob rituals for team alignment
    - You're working in regulated environments
    - You have multiple teams needing coordination
    - You want a proven AWS methodology
  </Card>
  <Card title="Choose Spec Kit if:" icon="check">
    - You want minimal workflow change
    - You're working on simpler projects
    - You prefer command-driven interaction
    - You want the lowest learning curve
    - You're a solo developer or small team
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Differences

### 1. Methodology vs Toolkit

**Spec Kit** is a toolkit—a set of commands that structure your prompts. It doesn't prescribe how you work, just helps you write better specs.

**specs.md (AI-DLC)** is a full methodology with:
- Defined phases (Inception → Construction → Operations)
- Rituals (Mob Elaboration, Mob Construction)
- Role definitions (AI drives, human validates)
- Artifact specifications (Intents, Units, Bolts)

### 2. Conversation Direction

**Spec Kit**: Human drives the conversation
```
Human: /speckit.specify
Human: [provides description]
AI: [generates specification]
```

**specs.md (AI-DLC)**: AI drives the conversation
```
Human: [provides intent]
AI: "I've analyzed your intent. Here are 3 Units I propose.
     I have 5 clarifying questions before we proceed..."
Human: [validates, approves, or redirects]
```

### 3. Design Integration

**Spec Kit**: No design methodology integration. The constitution file sets project principles but doesn't guide architectural decisions.

**specs.md (AI-DLC)**: DDD is integral to the methodology. AI applies domain-driven design principles during decomposition, creating bounded contexts, aggregates, and domain models.

## Common Spec Kit Issues (and How AI-DLC Addresses Them)

| Spec Kit Issue | specs.md (AI-DLC) Solution |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Commands disappear in Cursor | IDE-agnostic—works with any tool |
| Subfolder initialization problems | Clear project structure with Memory Bank |
| No GitHub Issues integration | Artifacts designed for team tracking |
| Brownfield support is limited | Explicit brownfield support with model elevation |
| Documentation gaps | Comprehensive AI-DLC methodology documentation |

## Migration Path

If you're currently using Spec Kit and want more structure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Simple Flow (Coming Soon)">
    specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Kiro-style Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Memory Bank">
    Enable persistent context across sessions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adopt Phase Structure">
    Organize work into Inception, Construction, Operations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Graduate to Full AI-DLC">
    When complexity demands it, adopt full Mob rituals and DDD integration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Summary

| For This Need | Use This |
|---------------|----------|
| Quick spec generation | Spec Kit or specs.md (Simple Flow) |
| Minimal learning curve | Spec Kit |
| Complex system development | specs.md (AI-DLC) |
| Team coordination | specs.md (AI-DLC) |
| Enterprise/regulated environments | specs.md (AI-DLC) |
| DDD integration | specs.md (AI-DLC) |

<Info>
**Bottom Line**: Spec Kit is great for adding light structure. specs.md (AI-DLC) is for when you need a complete methodology for complex systems.

*Can't decide? Wait for specs.md (Simple Flow)—start simple, graduate when needed.*
