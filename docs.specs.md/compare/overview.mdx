## specs.md: AI-DLC for Complex Systems, Simple Flow for Everything Else

specs.md implements AWS's AI-DLC—a methodology specifically designed for complex systems requiring architectural trade-offs, scalability, and multi-team coordination.

<Info>
**Coming Soon**: specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Spec Kit and Kiro-like simple flows for developers who want a lighter entry point before adopting full AI-DLC workflows.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. AI-DLC is a Formal AWS Methodology

Unlike generic "spec-driven development," AI-DLC is defined by AWS with specific phases, rituals, and artifacts. specs.md is a faithful implementation—not an interpretation.

### 2. DDD is Core, Not Optional

Agile frameworks leave design techniques optional. AI-DLC integrates Domain-Driven Design as its core—AI applies DDD principles during decomposition, developers validate.

### 3. Reversed Conversation Direction

In AI-DLC, **AI initiates and directs conversations**. AI proposes breakdown, trade-offs, designs. Humans validate and approve. This is the opposite of most tools where humans prompt AI.

### 4. Mob Rituals for Team Alignment

Mob Elaboration (Inception) and Mob Construction condense weeks of sequential work into hours while achieving deep alignment between team and AI.

### 5. Built for Complex Systems

<Warning>
AI-DLC explicitly targets systems with "continuous functional adaptability, high architectural complexity, numerous trade-offs management, scalability, integration and customization requirements."

Simpler projects → specs.md (Simple Flow) coming soon.
</Warning>

## No Vendor Lock-in

| Tool | Lock-in Risk |
|------|-------------|
| specs.md | **None** - works with any IDE/AI |
| Spec Kit | Low - GitHub ecosystem |
| BMAD | Low - framework-specific agents |
| OpenSpec | Low - lightweight |
| Kiro | **High** - Kiro IDE + Claude Sonnet only |

---

## Cost Comparison (Annual)

| Tool | Cost |
|------|------|
| specs.md | $0 + API tokens (~$2-5/feature) |
| Spec Kit | $0 + API tokens (~$5/feature) |
| BMAD | $0 + API tokens (~$2/feature) |
| OpenSpec | $0 + API tokens |
| Kiro Pro | $228/year + usage limits (1000 interactions/mo) |
| Kiro Pro+ | $468/year + usage limits (3000 interactions/mo) |

## Roadmap: Simple Flows Coming Soon

We're building lightweight entry points for developers coming from other tools:

| Flow | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Simple Flow** | Coming Soon | Kiro-style Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow |
| **Agent Hooks** | Coming Soon | Event-driven automations on file changes |
| **Vibe Mode** | Coming Soon | Unstructured AI coding with optional spec upgrade |
| **Full AI-DLC** | Available | Complete Inception → Construction → Operations |

<Info>
Start simple, graduate to full AI-DLC when your project complexity demands it.
